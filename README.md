<h2>BAMAZON node app</h2>

<p>Bamazon is an interactive node app combining MySQL and Node.JS. The app allows users to select the product they wish to purchase from the table and what quantity. The app will then update the table data and return the current stock-quantity. </p>

<p>As a customer, you would select the product you would like to purchase. Then you will have to choose how much you would like. Bamazon will then show you the items you chose and the quantity you would like to buy. Once successfully purchased, the Database in MySQL will update with the most current inventory</p>
